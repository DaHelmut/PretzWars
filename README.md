# PretzWars

Tiny HTML5 game which is actually a gift card made for a friend's birthday.

The goal is to grab the maximum number of bretzel before the "bretzors" on they tiny surf boards eat them.

Also, you must not touch them and avoid the bombs or you will die.

Reach the final level to get a special animation.

The sources include the graphics (svg files) sounds (off and mp3) and web browser and cordova sources.

This game was tested with Chrome for Android.

Have fun !
